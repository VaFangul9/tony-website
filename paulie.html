     <p>"You didn't go to hell, you went to purgatory my friend. Purgatory, a little detour on the way to paradise. The duration is different for everybody, you add up all your mortal sins and multiply that number by 50 then you add up all your venial sins and multiply that by 25, you add them together and that's your sentence. I figure im gonna have to do about 6000 years before i get accepted into heaven and 6000 years is nothing in eternity terms, I could do that standing on my head it's like a couple of days here"</p>
